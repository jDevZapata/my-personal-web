# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
### `npm run eject`

## Description

This project was created by me to establish my own website where individuals interested in collaborating or getting to know me better can access detailed information about my professional background. I believe that resumes often condense years of experience into a few words, leaving individuals eager to share more about their professional journey.
This website is responsive and was crafted using CSS without libraries, with the intention of practicing animations, transitions, flexbox, and more.
